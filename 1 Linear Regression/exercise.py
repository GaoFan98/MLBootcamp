# varianceâ€”in terms of linear regression,
# variance is a measure of how far observed values differ from the average of predicted values,
# i.e., their difference from the predicted value mean.
# The goal is to have a value that is low (it measures between 0 and 100%).
# So if it is 100%, the two variables are perfectly correlated, i.e., with no variance at all.
